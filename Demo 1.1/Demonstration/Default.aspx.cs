                //example: GeoSequence result = new GeoSequence();
                // here, GeoSequence will have properties that match those of the XML result.
                // google can probably explain xml a little better than me, but basically it is a language that defines data structures
                // in many ways, c# objects are just data structures. You just need to create it in a way that matches the xml data

            //use xml serializer to create object/array of objects

            //You can look into using an asp:ObjectDataSource object to access the data on the page.
            //otherwise, you can display it using labels, literals, etc.
            //EG

            //myLabel.Text = mySequence.Name; (just an example of what MAY be in your datastructure)

            

            //Unfortunately, web services are intricate: What exactly it want's for those properties is a little vague.
            //Your first step will be to give the method what it wants. It will almost certainly yell at you a lot,
            // but if it was designed well it will give you meaningul error messages and you will be able to figure out what to give it.

            //the next step will be getting the xml into a format you can use.
