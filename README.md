ZooPhy README

Overview
	ZooPhy is web application aimed at providing helpful and insightful analysis on virus trajectories to researchers and public health agencies. Using ZooPhy, users from around the world can access the repository of virus samples held in ZooPhy’s databases to find histories and construct phylogenetic trees and construct a visual trajectory of the virus’ pathways in populations. Users will be able to select specific criteria from virus type to host species and can drill down even further for advanced users. ZooPhy will start their query, which may take up to a few days, and then send them a notification when the process has been completed. This will produce a phylogenetic tree of the virus and also a KML file to place against Google Earth so the trajectory of the virus through populations can be viewed geographically by the user.
