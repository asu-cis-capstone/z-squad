							<h1>About ZooPhy</h1>
							<p>ZooPhy is a public health informatics application for phylogeography of zoonotic RNA viruses . The intended users of ZooPhy are health agencies, agriculture agencies, wildlife agencies, and any other researcher interest in surveillance of zoonotic diseases in either animals or humans. Phylogeography of viruses, such as zoonotic viruses (animal-human transmission) can support public health and disease surveillance. For example, it can help epidemiologists answer questions such as ‘For a particular geographical area and timeframe:
								<ul>
									<li>Which animal hosts most impact virus propagation?</li>
									<li>For a particular virus, what was the migration path?</li>
									<li>Where is it going?</li>
									<li>What was the trend of the estimated viral population within a specific animal host?</li>
								</ul>
                                ZooPhy's <b>BEAST</b> (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees) software provides researchers access to advanced data analysis. Users can produce phylogeographic tree models of virus evolution, Bayesian skyline plots for population genetics analysis, and create future virus and disease behavior projections.<br /> </p>
								<p>Once live, ZooPhy will be freely available to the public with the hope that it will help enhance population surveillance of human and animal zoonotic diseases and inform public health decision making.
