    <%--this is a master page
        It serves to provide sort of a template for your site.
        It makes it much easier to keep the UX consistent throughout your site.
    --%>
    <form id="myForm" runat="server"> <%--Note that this form will be used by all content pages--%>
    <div>
        <%--This will serve as the 'Page Title'.
            
            It is an h1 element with a 'Literal' in it.
            Literals don't convert to html objects, but instead plain text
            They are useful for putting text inside normal html elements and
            adding scripts dynamically to a page to help communicate with 
            Javascript from the Code behind.
            EG Script.Text = "<script> alert('Error!'); </script>
            
            I will be encapsulating this element in a property so that
            it can be refered to from the content page.--%>

        <h1><asp:Literal ID="lTitle" runat="server"></asp:Literal></h1>
        <asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="myContent" runat="server">
        
        </asp:ContentPlaceHolder>
    </div>
    </form>
</body>
